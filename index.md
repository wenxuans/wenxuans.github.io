## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, advised by Dr. Brian Bailey. Previously, I received a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Cognitive Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY.

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

My research aims to understand, design, and build systems and methods that support collaboration and learning in teams. By bringing together knowledge and techniques from computer science, the learning sciences, psychology, and other fields, I work towards designing systems that integrate data-driven techniques with human decision-making to enhance feedback in collaborative settings. More broadly, I am interested in how the ways that we work together will shape the ways that we evaluate each other.

** I am on the job market this year! **
